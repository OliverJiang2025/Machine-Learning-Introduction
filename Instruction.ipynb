    "# Overview of CUDA, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)\n",
    "- **Developed by**: NVIDIA\n",
    "- **Purpose**: A parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model that allows software developers to use GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for general-purpose computing.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Leverages NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate computing tasks.\n",
    "  - Enables parallel execution of tasks in a highly efficient manner.\n",
    "  - Popular for tasks such as deep learning, scientific computing, and simulations.\n",
    "  - CUDA C/C++ is used to write programs that run on NVIDIA GPUs.\n",
    "  - Supports libraries like cuDNN (for deep learning) and cuBLAS (for linear algebra).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PyTorch\n",
    "- **Developed by**: Facebook's AI Research (FAIR)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: An open-source deep learning framework that provides flexibility and speed in building neural networks.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Dynamic computation graph, which allows changes to the graph during execution (eager execution).\n",
    "  - Strong GPU support with CUDA for accelerated computations.\n",
    "  - Native support for tensor computations, autograd, and optimizers.\n",
    "  - Extensively used in academia and industry for research and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. TensorFlow\n",
    "- **Developed by**: Google Brain\n",
    "- **Purpose**: An open-source machine learning framework primarily used for training and inference of deep neural networks.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Static computation graph (define-and-run model), though TensorFlow 2.x supports eager execution as well.\n",
    "  - Strong integration with GPUs and TPUs for efficient computation.\n",
    "  - Extensive deployment capabilities, including TensorFlow Lite for mobile and TensorFlow.js for running models in the browser.\n",
    "  - Supported by TensorFlow Hub for pre-trained models and TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for production pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Keras\n",
    "- **Developed by**: FranÃ§ois Chollet (now part of TensorFlow)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: A high-level neural networks API written in Python that simplifies building and training deep learning models.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Provides a user-friendly, modular interface for building neural networks.\n",
    "  - Now integrated as `tf.keras` in TensorFlow, making it part of the TensorFlow ecosystem.\n",
    "  - Supports multiple backends (TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK) but is tightly integrated with TensorFlow in the latest versions.\n",
    "  - Allows rapid prototyping with simple model creation and training workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Scikit-learn (sklearn)\n",
    "- **Developed by**: The Scikit-learn community (originally from the Python community)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Offers algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model selection.\n",
    "  - Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, making it highly compatible with the scientific Python ecosystem.\n",
    "  - Includes tools for model validation and evaluation, such as cross-validation and grid search.\n",
    "  - Ideal for traditional machine learning tasks (e.g., SVM, random forests, decision trees) rather than deep learning.\n",
